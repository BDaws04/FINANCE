Mean Reversion Trading Method:
- Stock must have over 75K volume, model was backtested with AAPL stocks

Methodology:
1) Calculate a 5 day SMA and Bollinger Bands with a 2 standard deviation variance
2) Optionally for lower risk, also add tighter Bollinger Bands, with just a 1 standard deviation variance from the SMA
3) Once the pricd deviates above or below, either short or buy the stock respectably 
4) Close half the trades once it reaches the tight Bollinger Bands, then completely when it reaches the SMA
5) Alternatively if higher risk, only exit once it rereaches the SMA
