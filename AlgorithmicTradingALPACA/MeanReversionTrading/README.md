1. RSI2 below 10:
The RSI2 below 10 trading method is a short-term trading strategy based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, specifically its 2-period variant. When the RSI2 falls below 10, it signals that the asset is significantly oversold, indicating a potential buying opportunity as the price may be poised for a short-term rebound. Traders using this method aim to capitalize on these temporary price reversals by entering buy positions when the RSI2 drops below 10 and potentially selling once the RSI2 moves back to higher levels, signaling a correction of the oversold condition. This strategy is typically used in markets with high volatility, where quick, small gains can be consistently realized.
